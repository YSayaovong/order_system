This Python script simulates a menu ordering system for a coffee shop, allowing users to select three items from a menu, calculate the subtotal, apply tax, and provide a final bill summary.

## Lab Instructions

### Overview

In this lab, you'll develop a menu ordering system where users can input three choices from a menu. The system will return and calculate the final bill, including tax.

### Objectives

The main objectives of this activity are:
1. Create new functions to solve specific problems.
2. Use for loops to iterate over different data collections.
3. Create and use data structures to store, retrieve, and loop over data.

### Tips: Before You Begin

To work more efficiently in Visual Studio Code (VSCode):
- To view your code and instructions side-by-side, use: 
  - `View -> Editor Layout -> Two Columns`.
- To run your Python code:
  1. Right-click your Python file and select "Run Python File in Terminal".
  2. Alternatively, use the play button in the upper-right corner of VSCode.

### Instructions
